Description: Revert b31fa177c1ca26dcd2d5cd952e692ef87d95b528

Commit b31fa177c1ca26dcd2d5cd952e692ef87d95b528 was made to fix an issue
with nodes states but introduces a new regression wrt. energy power saving
mode where it leaves a way for jobs to start on nodes not ready yet.

We revert this patch for now until we find a better fix.

 This program will be killed if it does not terminate normally within
 60 seconds.
-This program will also be executed when the slurmd daemon is first started and
-before it registers with the slurmctld daemon.
+When slurmd is first started, this program will be run repeatedly until
+it returns an exit code of 0, and will block slurmd from registering with
+slurmctld until this has been satisfied.
+The return code is otherwise ignored.
 By default, no program will be executed.
